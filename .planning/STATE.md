## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Focus investor view for v1, defer M&A targets — Core use case, existing data structure, Friday demo focus
- Use Supabase (not Google Sheets) as data store — Team familiarity with modern stack, meets scalability requirements
- BDR agent as chat interface (not voice) — Faster implementation, demonstrates AI capability effectively
- Demonstrate advanced features vs fully building — Meeting intelligence and relationship graph shown in demo, full polish post-Friday
- Aggressive parallel development with AI agents — Leverage AI's ability to work 24/7 with unlimited parallelization to meet 2-day timeline

**From 01-01:**
- Tailwind v4 CSS-first with @theme inline and OKLCH colors — Better color accuracy, modern CSS pattern
- shadcn/ui New York style with Zinc base — Professional appearance for business CRM
- tw-animate-css for Tailwind v4 — Replaces deprecated tailwindcss-animate

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

**Timeline Risk:** 2-day deadline (demo Friday Feb 13, 2026 at 10am ET) requires ruthless prioritization. Phase 10 (Polish) must receive 20-25% of total timeline to meet investor-grade quality standard.

**Parallelization Opportunity:** Phases 7 (Google Workspace) and 8 (Real-time Collaboration) can be developed in parallel with Phases 5-6 if multiple AI agents are orchestrated.

**Security Controls:** OAuth token management (Phase 2) and AI prompt injection defense (Phase 9) must be built correctly from start — cannot be retrofitted after security incident.
