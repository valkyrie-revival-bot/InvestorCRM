<objective>
Verify the complete UI polish visually by walking through every page and interaction in the application.

Purpose: This is the final quality gate before the Friday investor demo. All previous plans in this phase automated code changes — this checkpoint confirms the visual result meets investor-grade quality when viewed in a browser.
Output: Visual verification approved or specific issues identified for gap closure.

  <name>Task 1: Build and start development server for visual verification</name>
  <files></files>
  <action>
Run the production build and start the dev server to prepare for visual verification:

```bash
cd "/Users/RAZER/Documents/projects/sales tracking" && npm run build
```

Confirm build succeeds with zero errors. If there are errors, fix them before proceeding.

Then verify the development server starts:
```bash
npm run dev
```

Report build status and any warnings.
  </action>
  <verify>
`npm run build` exits with code 0 (no errors).
Dev server starts without crash.

  <what-built>
Complete UI polish across the application:
- Brand identity (colors, typography, logo placement)
- Data-driven dashboard with real pipeline metrics
- Loading skeleton screens for all routes
- Navigation with active page indication
- Polished forms with inline validation
- Consistent component styling across all views
  </what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
Start the dev server (`npm run dev`) and walk through the following checklist at http://localhost:3000:

**1. Login Page:**
- [ ] Brand gradient background visible
- [ ] Both logos displayed and properly sized
- [ ] "Prytaneum Partners / Valkyrie Revival Fund" title looks professional
- [ ] Google sign-in button is brand-colored
- [ ] "Powered by VALHROS" text visible

**2. Dashboard (after login):**
- [ ] Shows real investor counts (not zeros)
- [ ] Pipeline value displayed with proper formatting
- [ ] Stalled count visible with orange highlight (if any stalled)
- [ ] Next actions due count visible
- [ ] Stage breakdown shows distribution

**3. Header Navigation:**
- [ ] Brand text mark ("Prytaneum CRM") visible at left
- [ ] Nav links have hover effects
- [ ] Current page is highlighted (active state)
- [ ] Brand accent gradient line visible below header
- [ ] AI BDR button styled with brand colors
- [ ] Logos visible in header

**4. Pipeline Page (/investors):**
- [ ] Skeleton shows briefly during initial load
- [ ] Table view shows investors with consistent styling
- [ ] Switch to Board view — kanban cards are well-styled
- [ ] Search works and filters update instantly

**5. Investor Detail Page:**
- [ ] Skeleton shows during navigation from list
- [ ] All sections have consistent card borders and spacing
- [ ] Form labels and values are clearly distinguishable
- [ ] Activity timeline looks professional

**6. Form Interactions:**
- [ ] Click "New Investor" — modal has proper labels and spacing
- [ ] Submit empty form — inline validation errors appear
- [ ] Submit valid form — loading spinner shows on button

**7. Responsive Check:**
- [ ] Resize browser to 1280px width — no horizontal overflow
- [ ] Resize to 1920px — content doesn't feel too sparse

**8. Overall Impression:**
- [ ] Does this look like a product you'd show to investors?
- [ ] Is the visual quality consistent across all pages?
- [ ] Are transitions smooth (no jarring page flashes)?
