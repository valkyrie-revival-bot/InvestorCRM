<objective>
Add write tools (update investor, log activity) with human-in-the-loop confirmation, wire the chat panel into the dashboard layout, and verify the complete AI BDR agent flow.

Purpose: This completes the AI BDR agent by enabling conversational record updates (with safety controls) and making the chat accessible from the main dashboard. This is the final step before the Friday demo.

Output: Fully functional AI BDR agent accessible from dashboard with read + write capabilities, security controls, and human verification.

  <action>
**lib/ai/tools/update-investor.ts** — Write tool with confirmation pattern:
- Use `tool()` from 'ai' with Zod inputSchema
- Accept: `{ firmName: string, field: enum['stage', 'internal_conviction', 'est_value', 'next_action', 'next_action_date', 'current_strategy_notes', 'key_objection_risk'], newValue: string | number, reason: string (min 5 chars) }`
- Execute function does NOT perform the update directly. Instead:
  1. Look up investor by firmName using ilike match (same pattern as get-investor-detail tool)
  2. If no match or multiple matches, return error/clarification message
  3. If single match found, return a confirmation object:
     ```
     { status: 'confirmation_required', investorId, firmName, field, currentValue, newValue, reason }
     ```
  4. The AI will present this to the user as "I'd like to update X. Here's what will change: [field] from [current] to [new]. Reason: [reason]. Shall I proceed?"
- The actual update is NOT executed by this tool. The client-side confirmation handling will call `updateInvestorField()` directly as a server action when user approves.
- This implements the privilege minimization pattern: tool proposes, human disposes.

**lib/ai/tools/log-activity.ts** — Activity logging tool:
- Accept: `{ firmName: string, activityType: enum['note', 'call', 'email', 'meeting'], description: string (min 5 chars, max 500 chars) }`
- Look up investor by firmName
- Call createActivity server action directly (activity logging is lower risk than record mutation)
- Return success/failure result
- NOTE: This is a direct-execute tool (no confirmation needed) because activities are append-only audit trail — they can't corrupt existing data

**Update lib/ai/tools/index.ts:**
- Add updateInvestor and logActivity to the tool registry
- Export `allTools` including all 5 tools (3 read + 2 write)
- Export `writeTools` separately for documentation

**Update app/api/chat/route.ts:**
- Import updated `allTools` (no other changes needed — tools auto-register)
- Add audit logging: after streaming completes, log the conversation turn to activities table with activity_type 'note', description 'AI BDR agent conversation', metadata containing user message summary. Use a background operation (don't block response).

**Update app/(dashboard)/layout.tsx:**
- This is a server component, so we need a client wrapper for the chat toggle
- Add a new client component `ChatToggle` inline or as a separate small component
- Add to the header (right side, before user email): a button with a chat/message icon (Lucide `MessageSquare` or `Bot` icon) that toggles the chat panel open/closed
- Import and render `ChatPanel` at the bottom of the layout (outside main content area, as a fixed overlay)
- The layout needs to become partially client-side for the toggle state. Options:
  - Option A (preferred): Create a small `DashboardWithChat` client wrapper that wraps `{children}` and manages chat state. The server layout renders this wrapper.
  - Option B: Use a shared state atom. Overkill for a toggle.
- Implementation: Create `components/ai/dashboard-chat-wrapper.tsx` as a 'use client' component that:
  - Accepts `children`, `userEmail` props
  - Manages `isChatOpen` state
  - Renders the header nav, chat toggle button, and ChatPanel
  - The server layout delegates header rendering to this client component

**Update components/ai/chat-panel.tsx:**
- Add confirmation handling for updateInvestor tool results:
  - When a message part contains a tool result with `status: 'confirmation_required'`, render a confirmation card with:
    - "Confirm Update" heading
    - Field, current value, new value, reason displayed clearly
    - "Approve" (green) and "Reject" (muted) buttons
  - On approve: call `updateInvestorField(investorId, field, newValue)` server action directly
  - On reject: append a user message saying "No, cancel that update" to continue conversation
  - After confirm/reject, the confirmation card becomes non-interactive (show "Approved" or "Rejected" badge)
  </action>

1. `npx tsc --noEmit` passes
2. Start dev server with `npm run dev`
3. Navigate to dashboard — chat toggle button visible in header
4. Click toggle — chat panel slides open
5. Type "Show me stalled investors" — should stream response with tool results
6. Type "Update [investor] conviction to High" — should show confirmation dialog
  </verify>
  <done>
Write tools created with confirmation pattern. Chat panel wired into dashboard layout with toggle button. Confirmation handling works for update operations. Activity logging tool functional.

  <what-built>Complete AI BDR agent with conversational pipeline queries, strategy recommendations, record updates with confirmation, and activity logging — accessible from dashboard navigation.</what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
1. Open the application at http://localhost:3000/investors
2. Verify a chat icon/button appears in the top navigation header
3. Click the chat icon — a slide-out panel should appear on the right
4. In the chat panel, you should see suggested prompts (e.g., "Show me stalled investors")
5. Click "Show me stalled investors" or type it — verify AI responds with pipeline data
6. Type "Pipeline summary by stage" — verify AI shows stage breakdown
7. Type "Tell me about [an investor name]" — verify detailed investor info appears
8. Type "What strategy should we use for [investor]?" — verify strategic recommendation
9. Type "Update [investor] conviction to High" — verify confirmation dialog appears
10. Approve or reject the update — verify it works correctly
11. Close the panel — verify it slides away and dashboard is fully usable
12. Verify the chat works with dark theme styling

Type "approved" if all checks pass, or describe issues found.

<success_criteria>
- All 8 AI requirements (AI-01 through AI-08) addressed:
  - AI-01: Chat interface accessible from main UI (toggle in header)
  - AI-02: Natural language pipeline queries ("Show me stalled investors")
  - AI-03: Strategy suggestions based on pipeline data
  - AI-04: Conversational record updates with confirmation
  - AI-05: Relevant investor context surfaced automatically (get-investor-detail tool)
  - AI-06: Prioritization and next action recommendations (strategy-advisor tool + upcoming_actions query)
  - AI-07: Input validation prevents prompt injection
  - AI-08: Read-only by default, write requires confirmation
- Human verification confirms full flow works
</success_criteria>
