## Out of Scope

Explicitly excluded from all versions. Documented to prevent scope creep.

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Mobile native apps (iOS/Android) | Web-first approach, mobile later when usage patterns validated |
| Real-time team chat/messaging | Slack/email sufficient, avoid building communication platform |
| Third-party API for external integrations | Internal tool first, API later if needed |
| Offline mode | Web application requires connectivity, complexity not justified |
| Multi-language support | English only for v1, team and investors are English-speaking |
| Custom reporting/dashboards | Use pipeline views initially, build custom reports based on usage |
| Automated email sequences | Focus on relationship quality not email automation |
| Social media integration | Not core to investor relationships |
| Fund accounting | Specialized domain, use existing tools |
| Portfolio company management | Separate concern, plan for v2 |
| Fund-level management view | Separate concern, plan for v2 |
